# Getting started with the Web 2020


#### This is my  ["Active Learning Examples"](https://vvpetkov.github.io/Getting-started-with-the-Web-2020/) for learning JavaScript tutorials from [MDN site](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web)


I will need this to jumpstart my knowledge for JS and everything around it! 

I start from their tutorials after several attempts to break the wall on JS!
